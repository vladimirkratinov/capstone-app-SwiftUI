# Little Lemon Food Ordering App

Introducing a food-ordering app for the Little Lemon restaurant as part of a graded assessment. The app offers a customizable user experience, allowing users to filter items by specified categories and search for items by name. Here's an overview of the completed app:

- **Item Display:** The app effectively showcases a comprehensive list of items available for order.
- **User Customization:** Users can tailor their experience by enabling filters or using the search feature.
- **Visual Representation:** The accompanying images illustrate the final appearance of the app.

However, one initial hurdle was the absence of a menu items list, which has been addressed through the following steps:

- **Data Retrieval:** I implemented a network call to fetch menu item data from a provided URL.
- **Database Integration:** The retrieved data has been seamlessly stored in a database.

To ensure optimal presentation within the app, the following steps were taken:

- **Code Transformation:** I wrote code to convert raw data into a suitable format for SwiftUI.
- **SQL Transactions:** Implemented SQL transactions to enable efficient sorting and filtering of data.

The app is now fully equipped to deliver a robust and user-centric food-ordering experience.
